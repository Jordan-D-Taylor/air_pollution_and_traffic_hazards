# Traffic Hazards of PM2.5 Air Pollution

Clean Air and Safe Travels.

Capstone Project for Data Analytics Cohort #11 program at Nashville Software School.

Pollution effects all of us and air pollution is a particularly communal experience. Many people may only think about it while sitting behind an old car at a stop light but those emissions can, and do, build in the local environment and cause harm even when unnoticeable. These pollutants pose many mental and physical hazards. Is the air in Nashville affecting my health? Is it making my commute more dangerous?


## Project Scope

As a parent to two young boys who run outside as soon as they wake up and as someone who values our shared outdoor spaces, I value our health and safety. I'm also a chemist and I have fun finding out how things happen and how to improve them.

A few months ago I was listening to the radio and heard a story about air pollution in the form of particulate matter 2.5 microns or less (pm2.5) and it's negative health effects.

“One of the most famous examples is probably the case of umpires … On days in cities where there’s especially high PM2.5, we see that these umpires make more mistakes … A lot of folks have looked at performance on standardized tests after there’s exposure. We’re also seeing this with behavior and depression. In more of the medical and epidemiological literature, we see that there are later-in-life outcomes that are very bad.”

Travis Roach, an associate professor and director of the Central Policy Institute at the University of Central Oklahoma, goes on to explain there is an increase in fatal car crashes associated with levels of exposure that are all too common.

This project aims to explore these concepts in the city of Nashville Tennessee.
## Questions

 - Does Nashville experience levels of PM2.5 air pollution that are a hazard and how does this data change the outcome of traffic accidents?
 - Can I present this information in a way that might inform people to make some better choices for themselves, their families and their community?
## Data

Nashville's city government offers many publicly available datasets. Air quality and traffic accidents are two of them.
